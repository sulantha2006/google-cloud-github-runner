This application is **exclusively built for Google Cloud Platform (GCP)**, leveraging native services like **Google Compute Engine (GCE) Instance Templates** to manage **ephemeral** just-in-time self-hosted GitHub Actions Runners. Unlike generic solutions that merely "support" GCP, this project offers a deep, cloud-native integration designed specifically for GCP.

For the developer, it functions as a **drop-in replacement**: just add `gcp-` to your GitHub Actions workflow YAML file (e.g., replace `runs-on: ubuntu-latest` with `runs-on: gcp-ubuntu-latest`).

The architecture prioritizes **simplicity and auditability**, avoiding complex abstractions. All services are configured **regionally**, giving you full control over data sovereignty. This ensures that strictly regional requirements—such as keeping all infrastructure and data within Germany—are easily met.

## ✨ Features

*   **Native Hardware Support**: Easily switch between **x86/64** (Intel, AMD) and **ARM** (Ampere Altra, Google Axion) architectures.
*   **Flexible Instance Sizes**: Choose the exact CPU and RAM needed for your workload using different GCE machine types.
*   **Workflow Jobs run in VMs, not Containers**: Better isolation and native support for tools that struggle in containerized environments (like Docker-in-Docker or system-level changes).
*   **No Kubernetes Overhead**: No cluster to manage, no complex operator configuration. Just Terraform and Cloud Run.
*   **Ephemeral Runners**: Automatically creates and destroys runners for each job.
*   **Org & Repo Level**: Supports both Organization and Repository level runners.
*   **Automatic Setup**: Easy web-based setup to create and configure the GitHub App.
*   **Secure Configuration**: Automatically stores credentials in Google Secret Manager.
*   **Cost Effective**: Runners are only active when jobs are queued.

## 🚀 Quick Start (10 Minutes)

The fastest way to get started is using **Google Cloud Shell**.

1.  **Open in Cloud Shell**:

    [![Open in Cloud Shell](https://gstatic.com/cloudssh/images/open-btn.png)](https://shell.cloud.google.com/cloudshell/open?shellonly=true&ephemeral=false&cloudshell_git_repo=https://github.com/Cyclenerd/google-cloud-github-runner&cloudshell_git_branch=master&cloudshell_tutorial=CLOUD_SHELL_TUTORIAL.md)
2.  **Trust the Repo**: Click "Trust repo" when prompted to enable the tutorial features.
3.  **Follow the Tutorial**: A step-by-step guide will open directly in your terminal.

## 📋 Prerequisites

All requirements are pre-installed in [Google Cloud Shell](https://shell.cloud.google.com/), making it the recommended environment for deployment.

Alternatively, you can install the tools locally on your machine.

> Note: If you don't want to install the Terraform and Google Cloud CLI locally yourself, you can also use a [Dev Container](https://containers.dev/).
> Try it out with the `Dev Containers: Reopen in Container` command in VS Code.

*   **Google Cloud Project**: A GCP project with billing enabled. The **Owner role** is the easiest option for this tutorial. If the Owner role is not possible, see [gcp/README.md](gcp/README.md) for the specific roles required.
*   **gcloud CLI**: [Download and install](https://docs.cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/install-sdk), then authenticate with your GCP account.
*   **Terraform**: [Download and install](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/downloads), than use for easy Google Cloud services deployment.
*   **Python 3.14+**: Only needed for local development and changes to the code.

## ⚠️ Cost Control and Predictability

> [!WARNING]
> **This project will incur Google Cloud costs.** This application creates and manages Google Compute Engine instances, which generate billable charges. Key cost considerations:
> - **More instances = higher costs**: Each workflow job creates a new instance
> - **Larger instances = higher costs**: More CPU cores and RAM increase hourly rates
> - **Malfunctioning workflows**: A GitHub workflow pipeline that doesn't function properly may run longer than intended, accumulating unexpected costs
> - **Failed termination**: Instances may not be terminated and deleted correctly due to errors or misconfigurations, resulting in ongoing charges
> - **Billing alerts recommended**: Set up [Google Cloud billing alerts and budgets](https://cloud.google.com/billing/docs/how-to/budgets) to monitor and control spending
> 
> **Use at your own risk.** Always monitor your Google Cloud billing dashboard and implement cost controls.

Despite these cost considerations, self-hosting on Google Cloud offers significant advantages:

* **Potentially Lower Costs for High Usage:** For organizations with consistently high CI/CD usage, self-hosting on Google Cloud can be significantly more cost-effective than paying for GitHub Actions minutes, especially for larger jobs or parallel execution.
* **No Usage Limits (Within Google Compute Engine (GCE) Quota):** You're not restricted by GitHub Actions usage limits. This is beneficial for large builds, extensive testing, or frequent deployments.

The following table provides a comparison of pricing between GitHub-managed Actions runners and Google Cloud with self-hosted runners (information provided without guarantee):

| 8 Core (Intel)  | $1.32 USD/hr | $0.268 USD/hr  | $1.052 USD/hr  | 79.70 % |
| 16 Core (Intel) | $2.52 USD/hr | $0.5361 USD/hr | $1.9839 USD/hr | 78.73 % |
| 2 Core (Arm)    | $0.30 USD/hr | $0.0898 USD/hr | $0.2102 USD/hr | 70.07 % |
| 4 Core (Arm)    | $0.48 USD/hr | $0.1796 USD/hr | $0.3004 USD/hr | 62.58 % |
| 8 Core (Arm)    | $0.84 USD/hr | $0.3592 USD/hr | $0.4808 USD/hr | 57.24 % |
| 16 Core (Arm)   | $1.56 USD/hr | $0.7184 USD/hr | $0.8416 USD/hr | 53.95 % |

GitHub prices are based on January 1, 2026.
Google Cloud prices are based on the `us-central1` (Iowa, USA) region using E2 or C2A machine types without disk space.

Further savings are possible through Committed Use Discounts (CUD) or Spot VMs.
For details on default machine types, see [`gcp/README.md`](gcp/README.md).

You can estimate costs using the [Google Cloud Pricing Calculator](https://cloud.google.com/products/calculator) or [gcloud-compute.com](https://gcloud-compute.com/). The minimum monthly cost for the deployed Cloud Run service is approximately $10 USD.

## 📚 Project Philosophy

This application and project allows you to create **ephemeral** and **isolated** runners for each job.
The core design principle is **"New Job, New Server"**.

*   **Isolation & Security:** Every job runs in a pristine environment. There is no cross-contamination or security risk from sharing runner instances across different repositories or workflows.
*   **Lifecycle:** This application manages the full lifecycle of the runner instance: `Create` and `Destroy`.
*   **Cattle, not Pets:** Servers are disposable resources. Long-running, shared resources or maintaining a pool of persistent server and runner instances is outside the scope of this project.

## 🛠️ Deployment to Google Cloud

Deploy the entire stack using Terraform:

```bash
git clone "https://github.com/Cyclenerd/google-cloud-github-runner.git"
cd google-cloud-github-runner/gcp
export GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT=your-project-id
terraform init
terraform apply
```

**What this does:**
*   **Provisions Identity:** Creates a Service Account with least-privilege permissions (Compute Admin, Secret Manager Admin, Cloud Run Admin).
*   **Provisions Network:** Creates a VPC and Subnet with Cloud NAT for the runners.
*   **Custom Images:** Creates two custom Ubuntu images for the runners (one for Intel and one for ARM).
*   **Instance Templates:** Creates different Google Compute Engine Instance templates for the runners.
*   **Container Image:** Creates the Container image for the runner manager and stores it in Google Artifact Registry.
*   **Deploys Service:** Launches the runner manager on Cloud Run.
*   **Outputs URL:** Displays the `service_url` required for the setup below.

For detailed deployment instructions and configuration options, see [gcp/README.md](gcp/README.md).

## ⚙️ Configuration & Setup

Complete the setup via the provided web interface:

1.  **Access Setup:** Navigate to `service_url` (from Terraform output).
    
    **Authentication Required:** All `/setup` routes are protected with HTTP Basic Authentication:
    - **Username:** `cloud`
    - **Password:** Your Google Cloud Project ID (value of `GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT`)
2.  **Create & Install:** Click **Setup GitHub App**, then install it on your target Organization or Repository.
3.  **Auto-Configuration:** The system handles the rest automatically:
    *   **Secure Storage:** Saves the Private Key to Secret Manager.
    *   **Service Update:** Configures Cloud Run with the new App ID and Installation ID.
    *   *(Local Dev)* Appends credentials to your `.env` file.

4.  **Update Workflows**:
    Configure your GitHub Actions CI/CD to use the runners. The `runs-on` key **must match** the name of the GCE Instance Template (e.g., `gcp-ubuntu-latest` or `gcp-ubuntu-24-04-8core-arm`).

    ```yaml
    jobs:
      test:
        runs-on: gcp-ubuntu-latest  # Must match GCE Template Name
        steps:
          - run: echo "Hello from Google Cloud!"
    ```

1.  **Webhook: Job Queued**: GitHub sends `workflow_job.queued` to the webhook.
2.  **Get Runner Token**: App authenticates via stored Private Key to request a registration token.
3.  **Create Runner Instance (VM)**: App calls Google Compute Engine API to spawn a templated instance.
4.  **Register & Run Job**: Instance starts and registers with GitHub and runs the job.
5.  **Webhook: Job Completed**: Instance deregisters with GitHub and is deleted.
6.  **Delete Runner Instance (VM)**: App deletes the GCE instance upon `workflow_job.completed`.

Instance creation waits for the Compute Engine operation and reports its result: capacity errors
(stockout, quota) fall back to the other zones of the region, in a stable order, before failing loudly.
The zone a VM landed in is stored in the `gha-zone` label and deletion looks the VM up by name across zones.

### 🔁 Reconciler

Webhooks are best effort. A dropped delivery leaves a job queued with no VM, a runner that never
registers leaves a VM with no job, and a job cancelled while queued never produces a `completed` event.
Cloud Scheduler therefore calls `POST /reconcile` every few minutes (OIDC-authenticated). One pass:

*   lists the queued jobs on `gcp-*` labels of every repository the GitHub App can see, and the live
    runner VMs (label `gha-job-id`);
*   creates a VM for a job queued longer than `RECONCILE_STUCK_MINUTES` with no VM (same path as the webhook);
*   deletes a VM older than `RECONCILE_STUCK_MINUTES` whose job is not running (never registered, or finished
    without the `completed` event), removing the runner from GitHub first so it cannot pick up a job meanwhile;
*   never deletes a VM that GitHub reports as running a job (by runner name or busy flag).

Every decision is logged with job id, VM name, zone and reason. `POST /reconcile?dry_run=1` reports without acting.

### ⚡ Preemption notice

Runner VMs built from `gcp/startup/install.sh` long-poll the metadata server's `preempted` flag and also hook the
ACPI shutdown. When a Spot VM is reclaimed (or shut down while its runner is still working) it POSTs to
`/runner/preempted` with its service-account OIDC token; the manager takes the instance identity from the token,
logs the event at WARNING with job id, runner name and zone, and labels the instance `gha-preempted=true`.
No automatic re-run happens yet.
